## Nephelai

Running out of cloud storage and you dont what to pay a subscription fee? Then with some unused computer hardware (old laptop or Raspberry Pi), you can have your own self-hosted cloud storage solution!

I intend for users to access their "Nephelai" through a web application that I developed myself.

STATUS: Currently in initial design phase.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
